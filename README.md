🛒 Zepto Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth analysis of Zepto's delivery data to uncover patterns in consumer buying behaviour and operational efficiency. Using Python's data science stack, I cleaned the dataset and visualized key metrics to provide actionable business insights. 

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: - Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization.
NumPy for numerical operations.
📂 Dataset Description
The analysis utilizes two primary datasets:

zepto_sales.csv: Contains transaction details including order_id, order_date, city, delivery_status, and total_amount.
zepto_products.csv: Provides metadata for products, including product_name, category, and base_price.
🚀 Key Features & Workflow
1. Data Cleaning 🧼
Real-world data is often messy. This project handles:

Missing Values: Dropped nulls in critical categorical columns like city and delivery_status. For numerical gaps in delivery_time_mins, mean imputation was used to maintain data integrity.
Duplicates: Identified and removed 216 duplicate records to prevent biased statistics.
Formatting: Converted order_date to proper datetime objects for time-series analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍
Top Performers: Identified high-revenue products such as Handwash (Personal Care) and Paneer 200g (Dairy & Eggs).
Geographical Analysis: Ranked cities by total sales, with Mumbai and Bangalore leading the revenue charts.
Delivery Metrics: Calculated average delivery times across different cities to monitor service efficiency.
3. Data Visualization 📈
The project features a comprehensive 3x3 visualization grid showcasing:

Trends: Monthly sales growth throughout 2024.
Distributions: Histograms of delivery times and pie charts of category-wise sales.
Correlations: Scatter plots of quantity vs. total amount.
Advanced Insights: A heatmap representing sales density by city and month.
📊 Sample Insights
Top Category: Personal Care leads in total sales amount (~23.4M).
Delivery Efficiency: Average delivery time remains consistent across cities at approximately 26 minutes.
Sales Peaks: December (2024-12) recorded the highest monthly sales trend.
