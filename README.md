🛒 Zepto Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth analysis of Zepto's delivery data to uncover patterns in consumer buying behaviour and operational efficiency. Using Python's data science stack, I cleaned the dataset and visualized key metrics to provide actionable business insights. 

🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries
Python: Core programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation, reading CSV files, and cleaning null values.
NumPy: Numerical operations and array handling.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization through bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps. 
📂 Dataset Details
Source: Zepto Products Dataset on Kaggle (or mention your specific source).
Format: CSV file containing product categories, prices, discounts, and ratings. 

🔄 Data Operations Performed
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values (NaNs) and removed duplicates to ensure data integrity.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculated fundamental metrics like Sum, Mean, Min, and Max for pricing and delivery times.
Exploratory Analysis:
